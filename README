Notes for compilation: it requires intltool and GTK+ to compile.

This is a modified version of LXRandR. Support for setting primary
monitor was added by Thoms Erbesdobler <t.erbesdobler@tean103.com>
on Oct. 30, 2016. See comments in various files and git vcs.
I've added this paragraph to this README file.
