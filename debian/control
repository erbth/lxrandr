# NOTE: I've changed the `Description' field of the binary Package below
# while adding support for setting primary monitor. I've also put my
# github fork into the vcs fields and altered the Maintainer.
# And I've changed the package name from `lxrandr' to `lxrandrm' in order
# to distinct it from the original version. Therefore I've added a conflict
# with real lxrandr.

Description: LXDE monitor configuration tool
 LXRandR is a GUI application for the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment
 (LXDE).
 .
 This is a very basic monitor config tool utilizing the X extension called
 RandR. It can let you change the screen resolution on the fly. Besides, when
 you run lxrandr with external monitor connected, its GUI will change, and show
 you some quick options to get your projector or external monitor working
 correctly.
 .
 This tool doesn't aim to be a full randr frontend. It's a utility for grandma,
 not for geeks. If you need the full power of RandR, get xrandr (console) or
 grandr (GUI) and read some tutorials.
 .
 LXRandR only gives you some easy and quick options which are intuitive. It's
 very suitable for laptop users who frequently uses projectors or external
 monitor and just want to get their work done without reading a lot of
 "geek-centered" manuals or command line tutorials.
 .
 This is a modified version of LXRandR, which includes support for selecting
 the primary monitor (added by Thomas Erbesdobler <t.erbesdobler@team103.com>).
